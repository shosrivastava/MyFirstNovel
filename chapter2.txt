My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. 

The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of 

Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, 
sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.
